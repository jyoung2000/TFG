# WanGP Backend Bridge

This backend can delegate `/api/generate` and `/api/generate-image` to an existing WanGP installation instead of using the bundled LTX/ZIT pipelines.

## Required

- `WANGP_ROOT`
  - Folder that contains `wgp.py`.

## Optional

- `WANGP_VIDEO_MODEL_TYPE`
  - Defaults to `ltx2_22B_distilled`.
- `WANGP_IMAGE_MODEL_TYPE`
  - Defaults to `z_image`.
- `WANGP_EXTRA_ARGS`
  - Extra WanGP startup flags passed into `shared.api.WanGPSession`.
  - Example: `--attention sdpa --profile 4`

## Environment Note

- The LTX backend interpreter must be able to import WanGP directly.
- `WANGP_PYTHON` may still appear in runtime config/logging, but direct bridge execution now happens in-process through WanGP's Python API.

## Behavior

- Video requests are translated into single-task WanGP manifests and executed through `shared.api.WanGPSession`.
- Image requests use the same mechanism with the configured image model.
- Progress comes from WanGP's native `send_cmd(...)` events, with stdout/stderr also streamed into the bridge.
- Cancel requests signal the active WanGP model directly instead of terminating a subprocess.
- LTX Desktop first-run "download" becomes a no-op when the bridge is enabled, because model management is delegated to WanGP.
